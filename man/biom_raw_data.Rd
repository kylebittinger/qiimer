\title{Extract raw data from a BIOM object.}
\usage{
biom_raw_data(b)
}
\arguments{
\item{b}{A BIOM object.}
}
\value{
For sparse biom objects, returns a 3-column data frame of row names,
  column names, and the data value.  The first column is named using the 
  first word in the BIOM object's \code{type} attribute (e.g. "OTU" for OTU
  tables).  The second and third columns are named "SampleID" and "value",
  respectively.  For dense biom objects, returns a matrix.
}
\description{
WARNING: This function has been removed. Previous versions of this function
did not give the correct result under some circumstances. If you have used
this function previously, please check your work by converting the BIOM file
to classic tab-separated values format and importing with the function
read_qiime_otu_table().
}
\details{
This function extracts the raw data from a BIOM object, using the correct 
row and column names in the result.

The BIOM object can be any list-like representation of the JSON 
source code in a BIOM-format file produced by QIIME.  There are several 
options for creating BIOM objects from QIIME output files.  The official
library for BIOM files, \code{biom}, can create compatible objects via the 
\code{read_biom} function.  Alternately, the \code{fromJSON} function from
either \code{RJSONIO} or \code{rjson} may be used.
